# Hack Recursive Function Stack Overflow

This repository demonstrates a stack overflow error in a recursive function written in Hack. The `foo` function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. If a large number is passed to the function, it exceeds the maximum recursion depth and causes a stack overflow error.

The solution provided uses iteration to avoid recursion and prevents stack overflow errors.
